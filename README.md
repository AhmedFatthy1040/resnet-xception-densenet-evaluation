# ResNet-Xception-DenseNet Evaluation

## Overview
This project compares the performance of three different deep learning models on the [WikiArt Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csurrita/wikiart-images):
- **ResNet**: Manually implemented.
- **Xception**: Pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **DenseNet**: Pre-trained on ImageNet.

Each model undergoes training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, with detailed results presented in Jupyter notebooks.

## Features
- Custom implementation of ResNet.
- Fine-tuning of pre-trained Xception and DenseNet models on the WikiArt dataset.
- Comparative analysis of training performance and final evaluation metrics.
- Visualization of results for insights into model performance.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:
- A Kaggle account.
- Internet access to upload and run notebooks on Kaggle.

## Dataset
Download the [WikiArt Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csurrita/wikiart-images) and upload it to your Kaggle account's dataset section. Ensure that the dataset is accessible to the notebooks.

## Usage
1. Download the notebooks from the `notebooks/` directory:
   - `resnet-50.ipynb`
   - `xception-art-classifier.ipynb`
   - `densenet-art-classifier.ipynb`

2. Import the notebooks to your Kaggle account:
   - Go to [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code).
   - Create a new notebook or import an existing one.
   - Upload the desired notebook file.

3. Run the notebook:
   - Ensure the WikiArt dataset is properly linked.
   - Execute the cells to train, fine-tune, and evaluate the models.

## Results
Detailed results for each model, including training curves, validation metrics, and evaluation scores, can be generated by running the notebooks. Highlights include:
- Accuracy and loss plots.
- Confusion matrices.
- Comparative performance tables.
